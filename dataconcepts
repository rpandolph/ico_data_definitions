**REVISED DEFINITIONS**
TRADE
Type of coffee:	Refers to the species of coffee. The two main types in economic terms are Arabica and Robusta. Other types include Excelsa and Liberica coffees.
Certified stocks:	The volume of Arabica or Robusta coffee stocks that are graded by exchange-approved graders according to the specifications of the appropriate futures contract (that is, "Coffee C Futures" for Arabica and "Robusta Coffee Futures" for Robusta) and stored in exchange-approved warehouses. The exchange for the coffee futures contracts is the Intercontinental Exchange(https://www.theice.com), which also maintains and publishes this data.
Special characteristic:	Coffee is considered to have a special characteristic if its covered by a certification/verification programme that is implemented internationally or by individual companies or can be classified as specialty/gourmet coffee). This is voluntary information recorded in Box 17 of the certificate of origin.
Mode of shipment:	Type of packaging used to enclose and/or protect coffee during transport. Typical packaging includes: Bags, Bulk, Containers, Bags in Containers or Bulk in Containers. This is reported in box 11 of the certificate of origin.
Exports/Re-Exports:	Volume of coffee leaving the statistical/economical territory of a coffee producing country/economic zone. This typically refers to net weight.
Net imports:	Are equal to  imports less exports or re-exports.
Quality standards for Export of Coffee:	target standards adopted by the ICO in Resolution 420 that proscribe the maximum number of defects and moisture content for exported coffee. This is reported in box 17a on the certificate of origin.
Value of exports/re-exports: The FOB value of coffee leaving the statistical/economical territory of a country/economic zone.
Value of imports:	The CIF value of coffee entering the statistical/economical territory of a country/economic zone.
Re-exports: Volume of coffee leaving the statistical/economical territory of a country/economic zone that does not produce coffee. This typically refers to net weight. Re-exports typically consist of processed (roasted/soluble) coffee, but may include green coffee.
Imports: Volume of coffee entering the statistical/economical territory of a country/economic zone. This typically refers to net weight.
Unit value of exports/imports/re-export: This is a calculated value of the total value(CIF or FOB) divided by total volume expressed in US cents/lb.

SUPPLY/DEMAND
Area under coffee:	Total area planted with coffee trees in production and in formation reported in hectares.
Production: refers to the volume of coffee that is harvested and sold in the market or consumed or used by producers.
Crop percentage distribution:	Represents the share of the total volume of the coffee produced/harvested for each quarter of the crop year.
Inventories:	Refer to the volume of green coffee held by importers and roasters. Information in selected European ports is provided by the European Coffee Federation (ECF).
Roastings:	Refer to volume of coffee related to the net weight of green coffee which has been roasted in the country.
Gross opening stocks:	Existing volume of coffee held at the beginning of the statistical/crop year that are carried over from the previous year. These are either estimates provided by Members or may be calculated as the residual of from the end of the previous statistical/crop year.
Per capita consumption:	Is the measure of the total consumption of coffee within a country/economy divided by the country/economy's total population.
Disappearance:	apparent consumption that is measured by taking net imports plus change in visible inventories.
Domestic consumption is the quantity of coffee used in or sold to the domestic coffee sector and not exported.
World consumption: Is the total quantity of coffee used in (or sold to) the coffee sector within a given statistical period, typically a coffee year. It is the total of domestic consumption in producing countries, plus disappearance in net importing countries with inventory data, plus net imports from net importing countries without inventory data

REFERENCE/TYPOLOGY
Form of coffee:	Refers to the level of processing. Forms of coffee include dry cherry, parchment, green, roasted, ground, decaffeinated, liquid and soluble coffee(define the forms additionally).
Green Coffee Processing:	Coffee is processed to separate the green bean from the coffee cherry. This is typically done using wet or dry methods, producing washed and natural coffees respectively.
Organic coffee:	Is grown as part of an agricultural production management system that includes the composting of organic materials, mulching, shade regulation and biological pest control. It excludes the use of agro-chemicals. For the product to be marketed as organic, it must be certified as such by a third party. Certified organic coffee follows the standards set out in ISO 17065:2012.

PRICES
ICO composite indicator price:	Is the price calculated based on the market share of exports of each group of coffee weighted in accordance with information contained in Annex I of document ICC 105-17 Add. 2 (revised every two years).
Group indicator prices:	Represents the indicative price for the growths within a coffee group in different markets. The Rules on Statistics: Indicator Prices provides details on what growths are included in each group, and the market share in each group.
Daily prices:	Prices based on prompt shipment, that is shipment within 30 calendar days from the date of contract. These prices represent various growths of coffee traded daily in select physicals markets.  The Rules on Statistics: Indicator Prices provides details on how these prices are collected and which growths and markets for which they are collected.
Exportable production: A calculated value equal to total production minus domestic consumption.
Wholesale price: The market price paid by the intermediate consumer to the commercial distributor.
Retail price:	The market price paid by the end consumer to the commercial outlet.
Prices paid to growers: The ICO secretariat collects this data from its Members that use different methodologies. The national average price paid to the grower at farmgate level, to another domestic stakeholder in the value chain, or the minimum price guaranteed by the Government to the grower. methodologies vary across reporting countries.

**Process/Method/Metadata**
United Nations index:	Refers to the UN index of unit values of exports of manufactured goods from developed market economies.  It is used to convert values/unit values from current to constant terms.

Value of exports/imports of all goods:	Is merchandise data as published by the IMF, UNCTAD and WTO.

Value of exports/imports of all goods and services:	Is merchandise data and Commercial Services Trade as published by the IMF, UNCTAD and WTO.

Votes: 	Calculated on the basis of a pro-rata distribution of average gross exports and imports performance in the four preceding calendar years.

Exchange rate:	Is the value of exchange (provided by the IMF on a monthly basis) used to convert national currencies to US dollars. Daily exchange rates used in calculating the indicator prices are from the Financial Times.

Consumer price index:	Is the index (provided by the IMF) used to convert prices and values from current to constant terms.

Average of the 2nd and 3rd positions in the futures markets:	Is the average of the futures prices of the 2nd and 3rd positions in the London (Robustas) and New York (Arabicas) markets.

Estimated imports:	In the absence of data from Members, alternative sources (F.O. Licht, Eurostat, GTIS, etc.) are used.  In the absence of data available from any source, estimates are made based on performance in previous years.

Processed coffee information(ratio by type): For countries that produce/export both Arabica and Robusta coffee, data for roasted and soluble coffee are converted into GBE and classified as Arabica and Robusta using a 50/50 ratio.

Derived production:	Calculated after the close of the crop year on the basis of change in stocks, total exports and total imports during the year.

Arabica/Robusta breakdown: Members that produce more than one type of coffee are requested to provide the percentage of each type produced.   Unless a separate breakdown is given for domestic consumption, the same percentage will be used in the calculation for domestic consumption of each type.

Estimated exports:	In the absence of data provided by Members, alternative sources (press stories, F.O. Licht, GTIS and import statistics) are used.  In the absence of any data available from any source, estimates are made based on performance in previous years.

Estimated imports/exports/re-exports (volume and value):	In the absence of data from non-members alternative sources (FAO, GTIS, UN Comtrade, F.O. Licht, derived statistics, etc.) are used.  In the absence of data available from any source, estimates are made based on performance in previous years.

Remove?
Gross availability for export:	Is the result of exportable production added to gross opening stocks and imports.
Number of trees:	Number of trees producing coffee and in formation.
Gradings:	report on the results of grading by ICE certified graders, which on a ‘pass’ or ‘fail’ basis for coffee traded on ICE.
