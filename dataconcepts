Imports/exports/re-exports (volume and value):	Annual data obtained from National Statistics Offices in non-member countries giving total volume/value of imports/exports/re-exports of all forms of coffee imported/exported/re-exported from all sources/to all destinations.

Estimated imports/exports/re-exports (volume and value):	In the absence of data from non-members alternative sources (FAO, GTIS, UN Comtrade, F.O. Licht, derived statistics, etc.) are used.  In the absence of data available from any source, estimates are made based on performance in previous years.

Net imports:	Are equal to gross imports less (re)-exports.  In non-member countries, net imports are considered to be the actual consumption of coffee.

Unit value of imports/exports/re exports:	Information derived from the annual data received in item 1.  It is the result of total value divided by total volume expressed in US cents/lb.

Certified stocks:	Is data published by ICE on the stocks held in warehouses linked to the New York and London Futures markets.

Daily prices:	Represent the spot prices of various growths of coffee traded daily in the US, German and French physicals markets.  These prices are collected by the ICO agent in each market and transmitted to the Organization in accordance with the procedures established in document ICC-105-17.  They are the basis for the calculation of group indicator prices.

Form of coffee:	Forms of coffee include dry cherry, parchment, green, roasted, ground, decaffeinated, liquid and soluble coffee.

Global consumption:	Is the result of world consumption added to domestic consumption in exporting Members.

Gradings:	In order to provide additional information on coffee quality the ICO monitors the results of ‘pass’ or ‘fail’ gradings published by the ICE Futures Exchanges of New York and London. See also Quality.

Group indicator prices:	Represent the price of each group of coffee calculated in accordance with the Rules contained in document ICC-105-17 and weighted on the basis of the exports of each group to the EU and the USA

Groups of coffee (see note below):	Refer to the traditional ICO classification for grouping exporting members in accordance with the coffee they produce.  They are: Colombian Milds, Other Milds, Brazilian Naturals and Robustas.

ICO composite indicator price:	Is the price calculated based on the market share of exports of each group of coffee weighted in accordance with information contained in Annex I of document ICC 105-17 Add. 2 (revised every two years).

Mode of shipment:	Coffee is usually shipped in one of the following modes: Bags, Bulk, Containers, Bags in Containers or Bulk in Containers.

Organic coffee:	Is grown as part of an agricultural production management system that includes the composting of organic materials, mulching, shade regulation and biological pest control. It excludes the use of agro-chemicals. For the product to be marketed as organic, it must be certified as such by a third party.

Per capita consumption:	Is the result obtained by dividing disappearance in importing countries (or domestic consumption in exporting countries) by the population in that country (provided by the IMF).

Processing:	Green coffee beans may be processed either by wet or dry methods of processing, producing washed and unwashed coffees respectively.

Quality:	The CQP (ICO Resolution 420) requests that exporting countries report information on the quality of coffee exported to the Organization on a voluntary basis via Certificates of Origin.  Coffee must conform to specified defect and moisture standards in accordance with Resolution 420.  See also Gradings.

Special characteristic:	Is coffee that has been certified as being grown under internationally agreed standards that govern the following:  4C Association, Fairtrade, Kaffee Practice, Rainforest Alliance, UTZ, etc.

Value of exports/imports of all goods:	Is merchandise data as published by the IMF, UNCTAD and WTO.

Value of exports/imports of all goods and services:	Is merchandise data and Commercial Services Trade as published by the IMF, UNCTAD and WTO.

Votes: 	Calculated on the basis of a pro-rata distribution of average gross exports and imports performance in the four preceding calendar years.

Exchange rate:	Is the value of exchange (provided by the IMF on a monthly basis) used to convert national currencies to US dollars. Daily exchange rates used in calculating the indicator prices are from the Financial Times.

Consumer price index:	Is the index (provided by the IMF) used to convert prices and values from current to constant terms.

Average of the 2nd and 3rd positions in the futures markets:	Is the average of the futures prices of the 2nd and 3rd positions in the London (Robustas) and New York (Arabicas) markets.

Estimated imports:	In the absence of data from Members, alternative sources (F.O. Licht, Eurostat, GTIS, etc.) are used.  In the absence of data available from any source, estimates are made based on performance in previous years.

Processed coffee information(ratio by type): For countries that produce/export both Arabica and Robusta coffee, data for roasted and soluble coffee are converted into GBE and classified as Arabica and Robusta using a 50/50 ratio.

Derived production:	Calculated after the close of the crop year on the basis of change in stocks, total exports and total imports during the year.

Arabica/Robusta breakdown: Members that produce more than one type of coffee are requested to provide the percentage of each type produced.   Unless a separate breakdown is given for domestic consumption, the same percentage will be used in the calculation for domestic consumption of each type.

Estimated exports:	In the absence of data provided by Members, alternative sources (press stories, F.O. Licht, GTIS and import statistics) are used.  In the absence of any data available from any source, estimates are made based on performance in previous years.
